# Extreme Segments
## Running
Run with:
```bash
    python3 convex_hull.py < [POINTS]
```
where:
- `[POINTS]`: It's the file containing the points, whose format is: `id:x-coordinate:y-coordinate`. Each points is separated with a `,`.

The app returns `solution.txt` with the `id`'s of the points that belong to the **Convex Hull.**
